List of human hormones
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The following is a list of hormones found in Homo sapiens. Spelling is not uniform for many hormones. Current North America and international usage is estrogen, gonadotropin, while British usage retains the Greek diphthong in oestrogen and favors the earlier spelling gonadotrophin (from trophē ‘nourishment, sustenance’ rather than tropē ‘turning, change’).
